# Adding AI services to Semantic Kernel

[!INCLUDE [pat_large.md](../../includes/pat_large.md)]

One of the main features of Semantic Kernel is its ability to add different AI services to the kernel. This allows you to easily swap out different AI services to compare their performance and to leverage the best model for your needs. In this article, we will provide sample code for adding different AI services to the kernel.

If you want to see any of these samples in a complete solution, you can check them out in the public documentation repository.

| Language  | Link to final solution |
| --- | --- |
| C# | [Open solution in GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/semantic-kernel-docs/tree/main/samples/dotnet/02-Adding-AI-Services) |
| Python | [Open solution in GitHub](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/semantic-kernel-docs/tree/main/samples/python/02-Adding-AI-Services) |

## Azure OpenAI
With Azure OpenAI, you can deploy most of the OpenAI models to the cloud and use them in your Semantic Kernel project. Depending on the model that you want to use, however, you will either need to add the model as a text completion service or as a chat completion service.

The following table shows which service you should use for each model.

| Model type      | Model            |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| Text Completion | text-ada-001     |
| Text Completion | text-babbage-001 |
| Text Completion | text-curie-001   |
| Text Completion | text-davinci-001 |
| Text Completion | text-davinci-002 |
| Text Completion | text-davinci-003 |
| Chat Completion | gpt-3.5-turbo    |
| Chat Completion | gpt-4            |

### Text completion deployments

# [C#](#tab/Csharp)
To add an Azure OpenAI text completion service to your Semantic Kernel project, you will need to use the [WithAzureTextCompletionService](/dotnet/api/microsoft.semantickernel.openaikernelbuilderextensions.withazuretextcompletionservice) method.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/../samples/dotnet/02-Adding-AI-Services/Program.cs" range="42-48" highlight="2":::
# [Python](#tab/python)
To add an Azure OpenAI text completion service to your Semantic Kernel project, you will need to use the `AzureTextCompletion` class.

:::code language="python" source="~/../samples/python/02-Adding-AI-Services/main.py" range="30-38" highlight="4":::

---

### Chat completion deployments

# [C#](#tab/Csharp)
To add an Azure OpenAI chat completion service to your Semantic Kernel project, you will need to use the [WithAzureChatCompletionService](/dotnet/api/microsoft.semantickernel.openaikernelbuilderextensions.withazurechatcompletionservice) method.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/../samples/dotnet/02-Adding-AI-Services/Program.cs" range="19-25" highlight="2":::
# [Python](#tab/python)
To add an Azure OpenAI chat completion service to your Semantic Kernel project, you will need to use the `AzureChatCompletion` class.

:::code language="python" source="~/../samples/python/02-Adding-AI-Services/main.py" range="20-28" highlight="4":::

## OpenAI
Similar to Azure OpenAI, depending on the model that you want to use from OpenAI, you will either need to add the model as a text completion service or as a chat completion service.

The following table shows which service you should use for each model.

| Model type      | Model            |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| Text Completion | text-ada-001     |
| Text Completion | text-babbage-001 |
| Text Completion | text-curie-001   |
| Text Completion | text-davinci-001 |
| Text Completion | text-davinci-002 |
| Text Completion | text-davinci-003 |
| Chat Completion | gpt-3.5-turbo    |
| Chat Completion | gpt-4            |

### Text completion models

# [C#](#tab/Csharp)
To add an OpenAI text completion service to your Semantic Kernel project, you will need to use the [WithOpenAITextCompletionService](/dotnet/api/microsoft.semantickernel.openaikernelbuilderextensions.withopenaitextcompletionservice) method.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/../samples/dotnet/02-Adding-AI-Services/Program.cs" range="70-76" highlight="2":::
# [Python](#tab/python)
To add an OpenAI text completion service to your Semantic Kernel project, you will need to use the `OpenAITextCompletion` class.

:::code language="python" source="~/../samples/python/02-Adding-AI-Services/main.py" range="53-61" highlight="4":::

---

### Chat completion models

# [C#](#tab/Csharp)
To add an OpenAI text completion service to your Semantic Kernel project, you will need to use the [WithOpenAIChatCompletionService](/dotnet/api/microsoft.semantickernel.openaikernelbuilderextensions.withopenaichatcompletionservice) method.

:::code language="csharp" source="~/../samples/dotnet/02-Adding-AI-Services/Program.cs" range="93-99" highlight="2":::
# [Python](#tab/python)
To add an OpenAI text completion service to your Semantic Kernel project, you will need to use the `OpenAIChatCompletion` class.

:::code language="python" source="~/../samples/python/02-Adding-AI-Services/main.py" range="43-51" highlight="4":::

## Next steps
Now that you know how to add different AI services to your Semantic Kernel project, you can learn now to add telemetry and logging to the kernel.
